Incorporating an application or web-based platform designed for the assessment of an employee's emotional state and overall job satisfaction, this system features automated form generation capabilities. Central to its functionality is a machine learning model leveraging Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques, which has consistently demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of 88% in predicting employee satisfaction with their current occupational status.

In order to bolster transparency and enhance trustworthiness, this system harnesses the power of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to interpret and elucidate the predictions generated by the machine learning model.
